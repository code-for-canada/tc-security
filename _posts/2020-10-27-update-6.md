GC Notify is a service offered by the Canadian Digital Services (CDS) through canada.ca to send messages related to government services via email or SMS. The service will manage templates, access restrictions, and ensure that outgoing messages maintain a visual consistency with the rest of the Federal Government.

It is based on the GOV.UK Notify service. My understanding is that it is open source. CDS was able to get a copy of the software and deploy it for Canada. It is well documented, and all the existing gov.uk documentation applies to Canada’s version as well. It’s great when governments are able to use software in this way.

## This is service only available to the Federal Government

They do check that you are a federal employee when creating an account. I tried to use my codefor.ca email, and it was rejected. I was required to use my tc.gc.ca email address in order to proceed.

This has certainly created my first pain point. My government email is only available through a VPN, which can only be accessed from my tablet. During this COVID-19 pandemic where we are all working from home, I keep my tablet on a shelf while I do all my work on my personal PC & laptop, which have a better setup.

Once my account was created, I thought it would end there. Nope. Every time I login from my PC, a verification email is sent with a very long URL to click. If it was a code, I could look at my tablet and write the code on my PC, but it’s not. I have to forward the notification email to my codefor.ca so I can click it.

But wait, there’s more. GC Notify allows me to invite people to the team so others can work on the same templates. This is also limited to federal employees, so I can’t simply add my codefor.ca as a team member without sending a request to GC Notify for them to add it.

It doesn’t end there. There’s one more limitation. Because my account is in “trial mode”, I’m restricted to sending emails to team members. Any test I run will only go to my VPN restricted email address.

The solution was a simple one, provided by Alex & Keith on the TC Marine Safety team: auto forward all my emails. Now I only need to figure out how to do that with my tablet disconnected from the VPN.

##It uses templates
GC Notify uses a template system for outgoing emails and SMS. Because these are coming from the Federal Government, all messages are sent with the same Canada header and footer. What you are configuring with the templates is the subject and the text that comes after the header.

In creating a template, you are presented with a text editor and a link to documentation on format codes you can use. It supports titles, bullet points, emphasis, horizontal lines, and customized text. By adding “((First Name))”, GC Notify will replace that text with what the software sends. Once the template is created, you are shown a “Template ID”, which is what the software we write is going to use to send messages out using that template.

It supports different templates for SMS & email, and you can create multiple templates. When you modify a template, it generates a new ID, so software configurations need to be updated accordingly. I’ve created an interface in Appian to manage our database of connection between our system and GC Notify.

GC Notify also supports sending templates by spreadsheet. Upload a spreadsheet with all the personalized data, and fire off a sequence of emails.
Tell me about the API
It uses a simple REST API that looked deceptively easy to implement in Appian. It wasn’t. There were a few hurdles to get through. The core of the API is JWT (JSON Web Tokens) as its method of authentication. Appian supports many different types of APIs. REST is one of them. Appian supports many types of authentication. JWT is not one of them. I had to implement this one by hand.

## What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Web Tokens. It is a standardized way of authentication. JSON is a format in how to transfer information. It is a comma separated list of name:value pairs, enclosed in curly brackets. An example of JSON used in JWT would be this:

```
{
  “alg”: “jwt”,
  “type”: “hs256”
}
```
This gets compressed to `{ “alg”: “jwt”, “type”: “hs256” }`. This tells the server that we are sending a “JWT”, and it is using “HS256” as its algorithm.

The next step is to perform what is called a “Base 64” encoding. With all those special characters, like curly brackets, it can cause issues when sending it over the internet. Base64 is a method to convert a long string into characters that software can understand without trying to process it. The Base 64 version of the above JSON is “eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9”.

That was for the header. It’s the first part of the authentication message that tells the server what we are sending. It confirms that this is a JWT, and we are using HS256 as the signing algorithm (it has its own section).

The second part is called the packet. We do the same thing and put in it things related to what we’re doing. In it goes the current time and the Template ID. This also gets encoded with “Base 64”. Then you combine the two together with a “.” to separate them. It would look like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIxMjM0LWFiY2QiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9
```

While that doesn’t make any sense to a person looking at it, base64 can be decoded. Anyone can take the two parts of that string and decode it to see what’s being sent. Because of the public nature of the message, what stops anyone from using my template ID to send emails using my account? There is a third part, the signature.

## What is HS256?
HS256 stands for HMAC-SHA-256. SHA-256 is what’s called a “one-way hash”. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a method that allows you to apply a password to that hash.

Some of you might be familiar with “MD5”. It is one of the earlier and most popular forms of a “one-way hash”. You give it a string like “test” and you get “098F6BCD4621D373CADE4E832627B4F6”. Anyone can go to an online MD5 generator, put in the string “test”, and you will always get that reply. But it is very difficult to take that reply and figure out that “test” was the original string. We don’t use MD5 anymore because it’s not complicated enough, but SHA-256 is the beefier older brother that’s much harder to crack.

This is how passwords are normally stored in a database. Instead of storing your password, the “hash” is stored. When you send the server your password, the server will run it through the “one-way hash” and compare the results to what is in the database. Only the exact same password will produce the exact same hash. This is also why passwords are considered non-recoverable. They don’t have your password. They only have the output, and it’s 1-way.

## Signing JWT with HS256
The secret to a good signature is the secret. GC Notify creates what is called an “API Key”. It is a very long password. They know, I know it, and I put it in Appian so the server knows it. It doesn’t go anywhere else. Secrets work best the fewer people there are that know it.

HMAC takes the one-way hash generated by SHA-256, and applies an additional algorithm based on a secret. The way it does this is very complicated, and there’s a link to the wikipedia page if you want to learn more, but you don’t have to understand how it works to know that it works.

If you take the same string and the same secret, you will always get the same result. If either of those is different by a single character, the end result will be different. I run the two strings above through the HS256 algorithm and encode the results in Base64, and attach it to the end of the string. Because GC Notify knows the same secret, they can do the same thing and make sure their result is the same as mine. This is the “signature”. The complete packet looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIxMjM0LWFiY2QiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.F-MyLviXTh60ROAlNK99CBTbD0GAJRxCMLUzI2waViQ
```

That string contains everything needed for the server to know what I’m doing and verify that it’s me doing it. Anyone reading this can copy & paste that string in jwt.io and see the packets. You’re going to get an “invalid signature” unless you can guess my secret. Here’s a hint: It’s somewhere in this post.

Anyone trying to change the contents of that message won’t work because you won’t have my secret in order to generate the same signature. The server will see that the signatures don’t match, and it will be rejected.

Inside that packet is also the “IAT”, which is the time the message was sent. GC Notify will only accept messages with times that are within 30 seconds. If someone were to take your message and try to resend it without making changes, it will expire after 30 seconds and the server will reject it.

## That’s complicated. What about Appian?
Appian does have a plugin for JWT, but it only supports “RS256”, while GC Notify only supports “HS256”. There is a big difference between those. The difference isn’t important here. They aren’t compatible with each other.
Because of that incompatibility, I had to write my own expression (Appian’s term for a function) to generate the completed packet. My greatest resource was JWT.io for validating my outputs against what is expected.

The first step was to generate the JSON. Fortunately, Appian supports this out of the box. I create the JSON object natively, and use an Appian function to convert it into a string.

The next step was to convert that into Base64. This wasn’t supported natively but, fortunately, Appian has a plugin to do this for me. A few mouse clicks later, and now I’m doing Base64 conversions. I check the output against jwt.io, and it’s a perfect match. I had my header perfect.

The unexpected hurdle was when I was preparing the payload. It requires the current time, but it has to be in what’s called “unixtime”. It looks like a long number, but it is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. It is how computers count time, and it’s not a number Appian makes available. There also weren’t any built in plugins. I had to write my own unixtime calculator.

Or I would have had to write one if it weren’t for Google. I found a forum where someone asked the same question and 4 answers down that page is a large block of code I was able to copy & paste, and it worked.

The last step was the signature. Like Base64, Appian doesn’t have native HMAC-SHA256 support. Also like Base64, there’s a plugin that does it. It even uses the same name that jwt.io says, hmacsha256().

That’s where I hit my biggest stumbling block. I was getting a different result than jwt.io says I should be getting. I verified the input strings, the secret, everything should have been fine. I went to third party websites to try their HMAC-256 encoders, and they were producing the same incorrect results I was.

This had me believing that there was something missing in the documentation. A step that wasn’t explained. I tried all sorts of combinations of base64 encoding and combining the two strings. I also tried double-encoding, and decoding their signature. I was stumped.

I reached out to C4C devs on Slack, and they pointed me to the CDS Slack Channel. Someone tried to help, but their project used external libraries for JWT, so it wasn’t very useful. I also reached out to my mentor, and he got the same results I did. We were both stumped, until my mentor hit on an idea. He tried a binary version of HMAC-256 and Base64 encoding the results, and that worked.

Appian had another function called hmacsha256bytehash() which, upon closer reading, sounded binary based. I tried it, and that worked.

That left one small problem left. Appian uses Base64 encoding. What I didn’t explain earlier is that JWT is “Base64 URL Encoding”, which Appian doesn’t support. Fortunately, the difference between the two is very simple. Remove any “=” from the string, replace “+” with “-” and replace “/” with “_”. This allows the result to work in a web URL without the server getting confused. It was easy enough to write an expression that converts Base64 into Base64 URL.

And then it was done. It doesn’t look like a lot of code, but it took me an entire day to get through all those hurdles.
