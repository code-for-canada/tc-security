We have transferred to a new project, so let's try this again. Welcome to Code For Canada Fourth Cohort Fellowship Security Screening Program Policy on Government Security (C4C4CFSSPPGS).

## Our Team
A quick introduction to who we are. We are 3 fellows from Code For Canada's 4th Cohort, assigned to the Transport Canada: Security project.

This cohort has 2 teams going into Transport Canada, following in the footsteps of [The Digital Drone Collective](https://medium.com/code-for-canada/meet-the-digital-drone-collective-42bc97b53ed7)

## Our Project
Internal Security Clearances. If you want to work for the government, or your job requires you to have access to a secured government facility, you require a security clearance issued following the guidelines of the Treasury Board's (TBS) Policy on Government Security (PGS). Every department in government has to implement this policy. Transport Canada is no different.

Here is a high level overview of the steps involved in getting security clearance:
- Get selected for a job at Transport Canada. This is important. Employees or consultants working for Transport Canada are required to have a security clearance. If you don’t work for Transport Canada, you don’t need the security clearance, so your application for a security clearance won’t be approved.
- Fill out an application form. This can be done with a PDF or Word version of the form. If your job requires additional security clearance (such as a Secret) you will need to fill out additional forms. If your job requires Top Secret, you will need to fill out many additional fields on that form. How many fields? Go back a post and look at the TSC application form. Top Secret is a lot more.
- Once you have filled it out, you will need to print & sign your application form.
- You will then either take this printed application form to Transport Canada in Ottawa, or be given an appointment to go to a regional Transport Canada facility
- When you arrive for your appointment, a Transport Canada employee will take your fingerprints and collect your documents. If you went to a regional office, these documents will be mailed to Ottawa
- If there are no issues with your clearance, your hiring manager will give you the date to appear to begin your job.
- When you arrive, your hiring manager will need to meet you at security with a form filled out so you can gain access to the building.
- Security will verify your ID, take your picture, verify what you require access to, and then issue you a building access identification card so you can enter the building and perform your job.

Currently, the entire process is paper based. There is a database that exists for communicating with external partners, but it is very old. Instead of expanding the existing database to handle more of the process, it is being replaced with something newer that will handle more of the process.


## Transport Canada
Every employee of Transport Canada has gone through that process, ourselves included. Without this system, the security and safety of the building and all the private data stored in it couldn't be assured. Work has already begun on the digitization of the process and we, at Code For Canada, will be taking their ball and running with it.

## Our Personal Challenge
The biggest challenge facing our team right now is Covid-19. The day we transferred from TSC and began working on PGS was also the day Transport Canada closed their doors and ordered everyone to work from home. We have had to be onboarded and introduced to the team remotely. Fortunately, 2 of our government partners from our Code For Canada onboarding in January have also transferred with us from TSCMP to SSP and will continue to work with us on a daily or weekly basis.

## Some Pictures

Our first attempt at the Service Map Blueprint. We are focusing on the process for a Top Secret security clearance because it has the most steps and a blueprint of that would be the most comprehensive. The process for reliability involves the same steps at the start, but ends sooner. Our initial version was also completely wrong and needed to be redone. So did the second version. This one has quite a bit of work put into it to try and make it more accurate.
