Appian is a “low-code automation platform”. It is designed, essentially, as a full stack solution to software development. It comes with everything you need, and supports almost anything you have. The goal is to be able to prototype, develop, and publish applications very rapidly.

Appian is one of the options being explored as the platform for the PGS project, and it is the platform our fellowship is using to develop our prototypes. It is not the first project in the Federal government to use Appian, but it is among the first in Transport Canada to try Appian.

## Why Appian?
Appian is designed for business process automation. It uses BPMN (Business Procession Model & Notation) to design the process flow. At each step, you can create a logic tree on what action to take. It can send notices, and prompt users to make decisions.

It has a drag & drop UI for designing the interfaces with customization of each element. When your form requires more complicated logic, you can switch to “expression mode” and see the source code of your form. This allows for some very fast development time, while still maintaining the flexibility a modern organization requires.

A simple form for testing our email templates. On the left are elements that can be dragged & dropped into the form. On the right are the properties for the selected element. This is the simple “design mode” that is easy enough for non-developers to work with.

## What will it do for PGS?
The most obvious answer is that it’s going to digitize the process, but we can do that with any platform. What Appian provides is the simplicity in doing that conversion, allowing Transport Canada to perform the conversion with fewer people and in less time.

Beyond that, it gives us a system to connect different teams in TC together. If all we wanted was digital, we’d be done. The simplicity of the BPMN system is being able to expand to encompass the entire process instead of only one piece. Instead of being limited to the application process, Appian can cover the entire onboarding of new employees. From the very beginning, with a hiring manager selecting a candidate to hire through to departmental security issuing a building pass, and it doesn’t end there. There is also the offboarding process when people leave TC, and we can do that in Appian as well.

Here is a process model from a PGS prototype in Appian. It looks like very standard BPMN, but each icon has properties that can be adjusted. The ones with a person’s silhouette are actions required by people. The appropriate person will be sent a message. They open the Appian website, and they’ll have a form to perform the required action.

## The Downsides to Appian
There’s the cost. An all-in-one enterprise level solution comes with an enterprise level price tag. Fortunately for those of us in Code For Canada, that’s not our problem to deal with. But, as taxpayers, it still remains a personal interest. It’s expensive, but not when compared to the salaries needed to develop a comparable system in a cheaper toolset. It’s not a solution for everyone, but it is a good one for Transport Canada.

The language it uses is custom made for Appian, and it isn’t comparable to other languages. You aren’t going to be able to find a developer who can start work right away unless they already have experience with Appian. They need to be trained. Fortunately, it’s a system simple enough that training is easy and only takes a few weeks. Once a developer has gone through the courses and understands the way Appian works, they can quickly get up to speed doing complex systems.

However, the biggest downside is going to be in its UI limitations. It was intended by design that Appian systems have a consistent look & feel, so there’s very little room to do things outside of what Appian allows. There are a lot of tools and options presented, but you have to use their options. Functionally, you can do just about anything. The limits are going to be in aesthetics, such as the shape of input boxes and doing fancy graphical effects. Things that might not be appropriate for a government setting where you want consistency across federal departments.

So far, we haven’t hit anything Appian can’t do that we want it to do. Fortunately, Appian does support a plug-in system, so if we do find something it can’t do, we might be able to write a plug-in for it.

Here is the admin panel for customizing the look & feel of the system. You can set the colours globally, upload a logo & favicon. These settings are limited to being global; they can’t be changed on individual forms & elements.
## What’s It Like Developing in Appian
It’s very different. Appian doesn’t use what I would consider a “programming language”. It’s not procedural. There are no sequential lines of code. Everything is a function or a parameter to a function. This requires a very different way of thinking. For one thing, you can’t change a variable except in very specific circumstances. Even a forEach loop is a function that returns a value.

However, everything is a function, and that provides a tremendous amount of flexibility. Once you wrap your head around how Appian works, it’s remarkable how much you can accomplish. I’ll use the above template form as an example to demonstrate what it’s like, and do a deep dive for the developers reading this.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-06-10-Appian-Code.jfif)

This is the Expression Mode for the same form. I’ve hidden the tab on the right to make more space for the screenshot. Instead of showing element properties, that tab shows the local variables. You can also see a large red box giving me an error. This is because I removed several lines of definitions to fit more in the screenshot. Appian is complaining that there are variables being referenced that don’t exist.

On the left is my code. You can see the bottom half is documentation. It gives me a list of all parameters for the function my cursor is inside, a paragraph describing the function, and then a list of every parameter along with what data type that parameter requires, and an explanation on what to do with that parameter. This is a dream feature, and it’s a huge time saver when dealing with a system that operates entirely on functions.

The very first line is “a!localVariables(“. This is a function, and its purpose is to generate the form. The entire form is contained in this one function; you can’t have two separate functions. If you were to compare this to a traditional programming language, the system executes the function and the form is returned as a result. The final parameter of a!localVariables is the “return”. In Appian, we don’t need to worry about the “return” value, so long as the correct function is called.

a!localVariable is a new function introduced in 20.1 that allows for us to have local variables. I’ve provided 3 different examples. The first one, local!email, is a null variable. When the user types in an email address into the “E-Mail Address” text box, Appian is going to store the value in the local!email variable.

The second is local!personal. This uses a Dictionary, which is the Appian term for an associative array. It stores a key & value pair. I’ve initialized it to an empty list. The third is local!gotYes, which I’ve assigned a default value of false.

One thing you might notice as a developer is that these three variables are separated by a comma. These aren’t lines of code; they are parameters to the a!localVariables function.

On line 5 there’s the a!formLayout() function. This is the function for defining the form, and it’s passed as a parameter to the local!Variables function. By default, this is line #1 function, but I moved it into a!localVariables() so that I could have local variables. In developer speak, because it is the final parameter, it mustn't be preceded by a “local!” definition so that it will work as the return value for a!localVariables.

It is also in this function that I have my cursor, and the documentation being displayed is the documentation for this specific function. What you might notice is that it allows for key’d parameters. A javascript developer might be familiar with this concept. Instead of having to pass every parameter in order, you can use “key: value” to define specific parameters. This helps greatly when dealing with functions that support a large number of optional parameters.

Line 6 is the label for the form. It’s still set to the default “Form”. I should fix that. I did fix that, but it was after I took the screenshot.

Line 7 are the contents. The curly brackets { } are what Appian uses to define an array. Each element in that array is going to be a function defining an element of the form, and it’s all passed as a parameter to the a!formLayout function.

Line 8 & 9 basically do the same thing as a!formLayout, but for a “section”. Sections are ways to group content together. The Designer Mode helps in getting all this correctly. As you drag and drop elements onto the form, this source code gets updated with the new layout. Changing positions means changing the order the parameters are in the array, or in which array they are in. You can move elements around with a mouse in designer, or by cut & paste in the source code.

Line 10 is a dropdown field. This is an element that can be dragged & dropped from the left-side designer panel. The parameters that could be seen on the right exist as parameters to the a!dropdownField function.

Lines 14 & 15 are the core functionality of the dropdown. These are the labels & values of the dropdown. They are defined separately as two arrays that need to be equal in length. This is being done with rule!ATLAS_EX_getAllTemplates(). This is a function I wrote, and its return value is a list of all templates. What is cut off from the screenshot is the “.template_name” and “.template_code” that reduces the results to a single field. Javascript developers (especially those that use JQuery) should be familiar with that type of notation.

Line 17 is the special exception. saveInto is defining an event. When the user changes the value of this dropdown, this will be executed. It is allowed to be an array, which I’m using, and each element of that array gets to be the a!save function. This is the only time you get to change a variable, and it only works inside the saveInto event. The first parameter is the name of the variable being written to, the second is the value.

In my example, I am calling rule!ATLAS_EX_getTemplateDictionary with a parameter that contains the value of the dropdown. This is another function I’ve created. It will take the value of the dropdown, do a database lookup, and return a dictionary (associative array) that contains all the data for that template, and it stores it in the local!template variable. There are elements of the form whose data is based on that variable, and Appian will re-run those functions with the new value, which can change how the form looks, automatically.

Developers might be wondering about “a!”, “local!”, and “rule!”. Those prefixes are to help avoid namespace collisions. “a!” are built-in system functions & plug-ins. “local!” is only available inside a!localVariables. “rule!” is for global functions that are made by developers such as myself. I know of 12 different prefixes. There’s one prefix used inside functions that holds information related to the function (fv!index would hold the current index inside the a!forEach() function).

Appian has functions for a lot of traditional programming features. if(), and(), forEach(), and lots more. I have been quite impressed with how flexible Appian’s functionality has turned out to be. Keep an eye out for future posts that delve deeper into Appian’s functionality.
