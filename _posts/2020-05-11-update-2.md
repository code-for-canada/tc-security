COVID-19 has affected how we all do our jobs. We are all working from home, and this has changed what we do and how we do it.

## COVID-19
We had the general misfortune of beginning our time on PGS with the arrival of COVID-19 quarantine procedures. For our first day on the project, we never left our homes. In meeting our new teammates, it was done remotely through chat windows and video/audio calls. Some of these people we had already met, but many were new names.

This has created its own set of unique challenges. We can’t walk from cubicle to cubicle being introduced to people. We don’t get to shake their hands. We can’t sit next to them and observe their work. A few people are very difficult to get in touch with because their unique COVID-19 related job situation has limited their availability.

This has also created its own set of unique advantages. With everyone working remotely and available online, all meetings and stand-ups are done remotely. There’s no walking between floors to get to the next meeting, or trying to find an available room to hold the meeting. There’s no time spent commuting, which means more time for either doing work or relaxing from work. Prior to COVID-19, virtual meetings hadn’t been considered or evaluated.

This has been a learning curve on everyone. Code For Canada, our fellowship, our government partners, and Transport Canada. We are all trying to adjust to this new situation, learning new things, and trying to share that knowledge. We are months into this, and it looks to continue for the time being. This situation might even remain in place for the duration of our fellowship.

## Working Remotely
One of the most important changes is a focus on more collaborative tools online, especially for myself. I’ve gotten used to sharing a cubicle with coworkers and being able to show them my screen so they could see my progress. That’s no longer permitted without violating many official health guidelines.

One change is in how I write this blog post. Instead of working directly in github for my drafts, these are first being drafted in a Google Document on the Code For Canada Google Drive. While git is very good at doing things like change revision, it’s not so good at offering comments, and it’s not a tool others in my team or among our government partners are familiar with.

Code For Canada taught us during our onboarding that we should work in the open using collaborative tools, and COVID-19 has made that a necessary requirement. Not just for us, but for everyone else as well. The things we learn during this time period, the skills we acquire, we’re going to keep those after this is over. The way everyone works has forever changed, and I believe it’s a change for the better.

The hardest part is communicating among us three fellows. No longer can one of us turn around and start up a conversation, whether it be work related or personal. That social interaction is gone. Instead, we have a chat channel where we can throw impersonal messages. It’s not the same.

Dear readers, do look forward to a post in the near future on the tools we’re using, how we’re using, and some of the things we have learned from those tools.

## Our Personal Lives
Working from home has made a real merger of our work and personal lives. We have meetings in our living rooms, or bedrooms, or home offices. Our relatives or roommates that we’re stuck with are around and maybe they’re able to overhear what’s said, or what happens in the house is heard on your virtual meeting. Having a relative walk in the room and start asking questions about dinner is something that has happened to myself.

Beyond that, COVID-19 has already touched two of us personally. Jude was on a family vacation as this was happening, and came back to a mandatory 2 week self-quarantine. I also had close contact with a relative who developed COVID-19, and I was also in a 2 week self-quarantine. Fortunately, neither of us developed symptoms, but it certainly had a draining effect on the people around us. The relatives I am living with, they checked up on me on a daily basis to see how I was feeling and if I had developed symptoms.

Jude calls it a time of adjustment, and I can’t think of better words to describe it. We are all thankful for the people surrounding us. We have been able to lean on each other to get through these times, bettering our strong sense of teamwork and going through the turbulent times of trial & error to improve our communications. Challenges that have only gotten more straining with a focus on working remotely, and most communication happening via text.

But the work continues. Discovery goes on, our government partners push us forward and teach us new things every day, and user interviews began this week. We aren’t as efficient as we should have been, but we adapt. We adjust, we learn, we improve, and we push forward.

Here we are attending a weekly stand-up with myself, Jude, Jared, and two of our government partners. It’s a very different stand-up than what we used to do, but we’re adapting to the environment. We might have to change the name to sit-downs, since nobody is standing for these.

Here are some research related documents on Google Drive. The script we use for conducting interviews, our plan for conducting research, and a survey to be sent and filled out by a larger number of people.
